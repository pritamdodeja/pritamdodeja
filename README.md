- 👋 Hi, I’m @pritamdodeja
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a better thinker by way of becoming a better programmer/engineer. My favorite thing to do is to do the behind the scenes catalytic work that makes teams/projects successful.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tensorflow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on difficult problems where probability of success is unknown/small. Specifically, I love working on data pipelines/reproducibility types of problems and aim to deeply understand and apply what the designers of the language/framework intended. I believe that well-written code reads like English, and is a great way to calibrate one's thinking.
